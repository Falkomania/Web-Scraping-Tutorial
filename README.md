# Web Scraping/Crawling Tutorial
Find the video tutorial on my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/dvlpr).

### Credentials
Make sure to update your login info in the credentials.rb file.

### How to Run from Command Line
To run each file navigate to the main directory (web_scraper) in your terminal and run the word `ruby` followed by the name of the file. Example:
`$ ruby auto_follow.rb`
or
`$ ruby auto_liker.rb`

### UPDATES (since videos were made)
I've made some fairly simple updates since the videos.
- changed the `while true` loops to `loop do` loops with a break condition using a constant variable set at top
- added more variables for counting, tracking, and info output
- added top 100 users on instagram at the bottom of `auto_follow.rb`
